# Marvel clicky-game
UCB Bootcamp  Clicky Game  

### Purpose:

CLICKY-GAME is a memory game built with React.js The goal of the game is simple, using your mouse, CLICK each of the 16 Marvel character cards in whatever order you chose - the order does not matter, only that you do not click the same card twice!

EACH click triggers the board of cards to reshuffle, thus, you cannot simply click the cards in the order in which they appear on screen.

COUNTERS displayed to the top right and left of the board keep track of your current as well as top score.
